Class Attributes
Instance attributes are owned by the specific instances of a class. That is, for two different instances, the instance attributes are usually different. You should by now be familiar with this concept which we introduced in our previous chapter.

We can also define attributes at the class level. Class attributes are attributes which are owned by the class itself. They will be shared by all the instances of the class. Therefore they have the same value for every instance. We define class attributes outside all the methods, usually they are placed at the top, right below the class header.
