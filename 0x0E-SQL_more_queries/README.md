MySQL constraints
last modified January 10, 2023

In this part of the MySQL tutorial, we will work with constraints.

Constraints are placed on columns or tables. They limit the data that can be inserted into tables.

We have the following constraints:

NOT NULL
UNIQUE
PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY
ENUM
SET
Other databases also have the CHECK constraint, which places a condition on a valid data. MySQL parses this constraint, but it is not enforced.
